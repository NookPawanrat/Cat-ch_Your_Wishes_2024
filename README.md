🌟 Cat-ch Your Wishes  
is a mini project focused on offering positive encouragement as you begin the new year with a wish. 
It's an interactive mock E-Commerce website tailored for pre-ordering your desired 'products' (in this case, your wishes) to be fulfilled in 2024, 
inspired by Japan's lucky cat Maneki Neko (招き猫) concept.
